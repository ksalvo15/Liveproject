# Liveproject
My two week Liveproject from 2023 with the Tech Academy

I worked on a rental page and I used an .NET framework and an MVC model to create an edit create delete and index page.
On the index page I created a table where all the rental history items would be generated. I formatted and styled it according to the style guide provided. I then created a sort dropdown 
with javascrirpt and creating methods in the controller to be able to organize it by a-z, z-a, damaged and undamamged.
